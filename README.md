# Movie-Genre-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. The model is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to analyze movie plot summaries and assign them to one or more predefined genres.
